# browser-rs

Most basic static html parser/renderer written in rust. The browser bundles it's
custom html parser and a renderer based on opengl gluim.

## Why?

Why not.

## What does it support?

Basically nothing compared to other html parser or renderers. You can create elements
and assign colors to them. It also do not support every element for now you can only
use h1, h2, h3 and p. If i continue development i want to add a proper parent-child
relations between elements and also more styling.
